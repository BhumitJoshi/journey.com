    <h2><u>Journey with Rama</u></h2>
    <h4><i>Dated: Feb 27, 2021</i></h4>

    <p> <b>Have I mastered Time?</b><br>
        On 25th February, I along with my friends had to head towards our respective colleges. We had to catch a train
        leaving at 6:27 in the morning from Lalkuan Station. Maybe the excitement of me having a good time with my close
        friends and the thought of catching the train early in the morning woke me up early, when I looked at the time,
        it was 2:44 am (too early). Oh, this often happens to me in, and around, some special days. I get back to
        sleep, after some time I woke up again and saw it was 2:44 am, completely shocked, I was like <b>“What!!, Have
        I mastered Time?”</b>, questioning myself, then I saw it clearly it was 3:44 am (exactly 1 hr. after my
        first sleeping break), then I laughed, pointing to myself and saying‘this, this Bhumit is going to master time ha-ha, nice
        one’. I get back to sleep again.</p>

    <p> <b>Inexplicable love of Maa?</b><br>
        It was 4:50 am when I got up. I washed myself and packed my remaining stuff. At 6:04am my phone ranged, it was Sanjana (my friend). 
        At the time she called, she had already reached to the station, and at that moment I was at home, 
        savouring mom-made platable Paratha. After some time, I heard horn of Train, then I
        hurried myself up. I asked my father to make it quick, as he was going to drive me to the station. I took my luggage and
        went downstairs. My mother came running after me, with a lunch box with her <i>(that’s the mom’s love, which makes them
        different from everybody else)</i>. Mom opened the gate, and my father and I left. By the time we reached, the train had
        already arrived to the station.</p>


    <p> <b>Am I looking a Toddler?</b><br>
        In Platform 1, I saw Manya (my friend) struggling to lift her luggage in the stairs. She was along with
        her mom. I extended my greeting to both and tried to help her with her luggage, but as a social convention she
        refused.Then I walked ahead of them and reached to the platform 5 (where our train arrives). As soon as I took a step in
        the platform 5, I saw Sanjana, who was about 40 meters away from me. She was standing completely still and
        facing towards the train, it seemed like she is playing door escaping riddle and deeply contemplating on, which
        door should I choose to move in-the train. I approached her and gesticulated her ‘this way’, I am not good at
        reading facial clues but here I can figure it out that she was not able to recognize me well. ‘Had it
        been so long that she is unable to recognize her such a close friend’, I thought. But she followed me, maybe she
        recognized me afterward. We greeted each other and our parents left. Both of them were carrying 2 trolley bags
        and 1 backpack, whereas I on the other hand was carrying a small trolley bag and a laptop bag, well simply ‘they
        are girls’ seems to be a self-explanatory answer. I started putting all the bags on the overhead racks. ‘You
        alone wouldn’t be able to lift my bag’ Sanjana said. I know I look a little younger than my age but am I looking a
        preschooler to her, who unable to lift her 7-8 Kg bag. Without uttering a word, I picked her trolley bag
        gently and put it on the rack. But I have to say Manya's bag was as heavy as Manya herself <i>(intended as humour)</i>,
        it seemed like she is carrying too much gehna (gold jewellery) in her bag. For lifting her bag above my own head, I took assistance of Manya.
        Well, we all got settled and the train picked up its pace and here we come where the Journey with Rama begins. </p>
